<h1>Brenda & Josephine Project1</h1>
Summary:<br>
Our project  is about  creating a user <br> 
and redirecting them to the currency converter<br>
where they can convert their currency to RWF
 <br><br>

Libraries you will need: <br>

<ul>
<li>tkinter</li>
<li>Unittest</li>
<li>datetime</li>

</ul>

<h2>Milestones:</h2>
We have created a currency converter and a simple interface for the conversion<br>

<h3>To do:</h3>
We are still designing a fully functional interface with multiple pages.<br>
This will allow our users to register their details and then navigate to the converter,<br>
so that we can keep their details for future research purposes.

<br><li>We will have a fully functional API soon! </li>
